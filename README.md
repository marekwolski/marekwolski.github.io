## marekwolski.github.io

This is my new web site to write about my development projects.
I'm using Github Pages for it.

I've set up a CNAME in my DNS so that this web site URL is marekdev.wolski.me.uk.

Need to get the hang of using .md files and html files together.
and the use of Themes/Jekyll.
